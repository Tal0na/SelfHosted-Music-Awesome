# 🎵 Adding Lyrics to Selfhost Music

This guide explains how Selfhost Music searches for lyrics and how you can easily add them to your music files.

---

## ✅ Quick Overview

Selfhost Music supports:

- 📄 External lyric files (`.lrc` or `.txt`)
- 🏷️ Embedded lyrics inside audio file tags

By default, Selfhost Music searches in this order:

.lrc → .txt → embedded

This is controlled by the environment variable:

ND_LYRICSPRIORITY

Default value:

.lrc,.txt,embedded

---

## 1️⃣ External Synced Lyrics (.lrc)

This is the best option if you want **synchronized (karaoke-style) lyrics**.

## 📌 Step 1 — Match the filename exactly

The lyric file must:

- Have the **same base name** as the audio file
- Be in the **same folder**

Example:

01 - My Song.mp3
01 - My Song.lrc

⚠️ On Linux systems, filenames are case-sensitive.

---

## 📌 Step 2 — Use correct LRC format

Example:

[00:12.00] First line of lyrics
[00:34.50] Second line of lyrics

Format:

[mm:ss.xx] Lyrics line

Selfhost Music will automatically sync the lyrics during playback.

---

## 2️⃣ Embedded Lyrics (Unsynchronized)

Use this if you only want **static lyrics (no timing)**.

Lyrics are stored inside the audio file metadata:

- MP3 → `USLT` tag
- FLAC / OGG → `LYRICS` or `UNSYNCEDLYRICS` field

---

## 🛠 Tools to Add Embedded Lyrics

### Mp3tag (Windows)

- Open file
- Go to **Extended Tags**
- Add or edit the `LYRICS` field

### Kid3 (Windows / Linux / macOS)

- Edit the **Unsynchronised lyrics** field

### CLI Tools (for advanced users)

- `eyeD3`
- `mid3v2`
- `vorbiscomment`

Useful for bulk scripting.

---

## 3️⃣ Configure Lyrics Priority

You can change the search order using:

ND_LYRICSPRIORITY

Example values:

.lrc,.txt,embedded
embedded,.lrc

---

Restart-Service

## 4️⃣ Force a Library Rescan

After adding lyrics:

 - Restart Selfhost Music
 - Use the Scan option in the Admin panel
 - Modify the file date to trigger re-indexing

## 5️⃣ Minimal LRC Example

[00:00.00] Intro
[00:15.20] Verse 1 line 1
[00:22.50] Verse 1 line 2

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

✔️ Filenames must match exactly
✔️ Check ND_LYRICSPRIORITY
✔️ If embedded lyrics don’t show, confirm correct tag field
✔️ Enable debug logs with:

ND_LOGLEVEL=debug
